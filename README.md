🔍 What This Project Does
This system captures audio from a microphone or audio input—and uses AI to instantly transcribe speech into text. The goal is for users to see the spoken words appear on screen as they’re said, with very little lag.

🧠 How It Works (Generally)
Audio Input: Captures live audio through a mic or stream.

Preprocessing: Removes noise, normalizes volume, and ensures clarity.

AI-Powered Transcription: Uses a speech recognition engine like Whisper by OpenAI or Vosk to process the audio.

Real-Time Display: Streams the output text continuously to a screen or file.

💡 Real-World Use Cases
Live captioning during meetings or lectures

Helping users with hearing impairments

Real-time transcription for journalists or podcasters

Instant translation (if paired with a translation model)

🛠️ Tech Stack Ideas
You could build this using:

Python with libraries like pyaudio, speechrecognition, or whisper

Node.js + WebSockets for live streaming

React or Electron for a UI that shows live captions
